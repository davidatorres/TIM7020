Course NU - TIM-7020 - Databases and Business Intelligence

Throughout this course I used data was sourced from the U.S. Department of Educationâ€™s Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS)(National Center for Education Statistics, 2022) and the Congressional Legislators' data page on GitHub(Willis, 2019). **T**he data encoding web service from Geocodio ([https://geocod.io](https://geocod.io/)) was used to relate Institutions to members of Congress based on the longitude and latitude of the Institution.

The code within this repository was created for my own purposes based on a theoretical purpose.
